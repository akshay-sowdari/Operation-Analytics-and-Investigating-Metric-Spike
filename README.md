# Operation-Analytics-and-Investigating-Metric-Spike
This project delves into the concept of Operation Analytics which involves conducting an analysis of a company's entire end-to-end operations, which helps identify areas that require improvement. Operation Analytics specialists collaborate closely with various teams such as operations, support, and marketing to extract valuable insights from the data collected.
As a Data Analyst in Operation Analytics, it's crucial to investigate any sudden spikes in metrics. This involves not only understanding why metrics such as daily engagement or sales have declined but also effectively communicating these insights to other teams. Investigating metric spikes is a daily task that helps uncover the reasons behind fluctuations in business performance.
The ultimate objective is to address the inquiries raised by various departments and extract meaningful insights from the diverse data sets and tables provided.
